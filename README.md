# Bomberman

This is a Bomberman Game Prototype which has been implemented without using tilemap.
The assets and sound files used in this have been downloaded from different locations. 

Player spawns on the top left block and moves using WASD or arrow keys and places bomb using spacebar.
The player wins if he kills all the enemies.
Currently, 100 points are awarded every time an enemy is killed and 50 points are awarded every time a destructible tile is destroyed.


Please play and have fun. If you are willing to provide me with some feedback, I know I can use it to make my future games better.
